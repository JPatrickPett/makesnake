# makesnake

generate snakemake pipeline from list of scriptsusing cookiecutter

TODO:
  - [] place "num" before rule names, if first character is a number (snakemake does not accept numbers as first character)
  - [] add yaml anchor to config.yaml general settings for `execute_runs`
  - [x] save compiled config file for debugging
  - [x] check how to keep temp scripts in .snakemake folder
